Contents
===============================================================
All code used in the manuscript is available upon request. Here we provide
basic code that segments and runs out routine on an example wing.

Segment Wing Image 
	-Code and example wing used to segment wings in the manuscript.
Optimization
	-Code used to perform area-weighted circularity optimization

Code Requirements
===============================================================
	All Python Code Python v 2.7
	Anaconda makes installing all packages easy.
	All Mathematica code works in Mathematica 10 and 11
	Dependencies:
		numy, scipy, Pillow, matplotlib
		scikit-fmm [https://github.com/scikit-fmm/scikit-fmm]

Here is a great twitter thread from Seth Donoughe: https://twitter.com/seth_donoughe/status/1041802508585394177
Below, I reproduce some of the highlights.

Dragonfly wings show a large selection of interesting geometric shapes. Simple models, like Voronoi cells, do not accurately capture observed shapes.
We amassed a dataset of ~500 dragonfly and damselfly wings and performed a thorough analysis and segmentation of the geometric patterns. Code and data provided.

From this data, we hypothesized a developmental model where repulsive centers equilibrate on a developing wing.

Below, I show a real wing and a wing generated by our model. This is an image we provided for a [ScienceNews](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-math-helps-explain-delicate-patterns-dragonfly-wings) article.

We find that this model is able to capture some motifs from other insects as well!
